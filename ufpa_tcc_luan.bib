  Abstract                 = {Motion estimation is one of the important procedures in the all video encoders. Most of the complexity of the video coder depends on the complexity of the motion estimation step. The original motion estimation algorithm has a remarkable complexity and therefore many improvements were proposed to enhance the crude version of the motion estimation. The basic idea of many of these works were to optimize some distortion function for mean squared error (MSE) or sum of absolute difference (SAD) in block matching. But it is shown that these metrics do not conclude the quality as it is, on the other hand, they are not compatible with the human visual system (HVS). In this paper we explored the usage of the image quality metrics in the video coding and more specific in the motion estimation. We have utilized the perceptual image quality metrics instead of MSE or SAD in the block based motion estimation. Three different metrics have used: structural similarity or SSIM, complex wavelet structural similarity or CW-SSIM, visual information fidelity or VIF. Experimental results showed that usage of the quality criterions can improve the compression rate while the quality remains fix and thus better quality in coded video at the same bit budget.},

  Abstract                 = {The stabilized contrast-sensitivity function measured at a constant retinal velocity is tuned to a particular spatial frequency, which is inversely related to the velocity chosen. The Fourier transforms of these constant-velocity passbands have the same form as retinal receptive fields of various sizes. At low velocities, in the range of the natural drift motions of the eye, the stabilized contrast-sensitivity function matches the normal, unstabilized result. At higher velocities (corresponding to motions of objects in the environment), this curve maintains the same shape but shifts toward lower spatial frequencies. The constant-velocity passband is displaced across the spatio-temporal frequency domain in a manner that is almost symmetric about the constant-velocity plane at $\nu$ $=$ 2 deg/s. Interpolating these diagonal profiles by a suitable analytic expression, we construct the spatio-temporal threshold surface for stabilized vision, and display its properties in terms of the usual frequency parameters; e.g., at low spatial frequencies, the temporal response becomes nearly independent of spatial frequency, while at low temporal frequencies, the spatial response becomes independent of temporal frequency.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a great deal of interest in methods to assess the perceptual quality of a video sequence in a full reference framework. Motion plays an important role in human perception of video and videos suffer from several artifacts that have to deal with inaccuracies in the representation of motion in the test video compared to the reference. However, existing algorithms to measure video quality focus primarily on capturing spatial artifacts in the video signal, and are inadequate at modeling motion perception and capturing temporal artifacts in videos. We present an objective, full reference video quality index known as the MOtion-based Video Integrity Evaluation (MOVIE) index that integrates both spatial and temporal aspects of distortion assessment. MOVIE explicitly uses motion information from the reference video and evaluates the quality of the test video along the motion trajectories of the reference video. The performance of MOVIE is evaluated using the VQEG FR-TV Phase I dataset and MOVIE is shown to be competitive with, and even out-perform, existing video quality assessment systems.},
